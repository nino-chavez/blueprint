"""SessionStart hook — inject Blueprint canonical methodology into a fresh session.

Encoded response to the 2026-05-25 three-session failure mode: three live consumer
sessions reasoned from first principles instead of reading the canonical docs,
then disagreed about what Blueprint *is*. Failing to load the canonical sources
at session start is a direct violation of Blueprint's own first principle
applied to Blueprint itself.

This hook fires only when the cwd is a Blueprint initiative (detected by a
`blueprint.yml` in cwd or any ancestor). For non-Blueprint sessions, exit 0
silently — no injection.

Load order (codified, not arbitrary):
  1. METHODOLOGY.md            — what Blueprint is, the first principle, the pipeline
  2. docs/variant-selection.md — which pipeline shape applies to this initiative
  3. docs/portal-and-tier-ladder.md — which portal pattern (A/B) and which tier (0/1/2)

This order matches the question hierarchy any consumer session needs to answer
before proposing methodology changes from scratch.

Resolution: BLUEPRINT_HOME env var, else `~/Workspace/dev/wip/blueprint`.

Output protocol: Claude Code SessionStart hooks emit a JSON object on stdout
with a `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` field. The content of that field
is injected into the session as a user-visible system reminder.
